Suggested Improvements With Time and Scope:
1. Increased test coverage - unit tests for other repositories, usecases, viewmodels and instrumented tests for
    activities utilising espresso and mockwebserver
2. Refactoring direction determination logic to take advantage of Kotlin's Range and Version
3. Dark theme to take leverage of Android Q
4. Master-Design flow to support tablets more effectively
5. Implementing in-memory cache although values are cached in Retrofit for API calls and Room for local storage
6. Implementing showing current temperature for the saved cities - the setup is almost done, the models support holding
this data, just need to implement API calls to retrieve them
